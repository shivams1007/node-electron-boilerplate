# Node and Electron Boilerplate

This repository serves as a boilerplate for Node.js and Electron applications, providing a starting point for development. It includes basic configurations and structure to kickstart your project.

## Getting Started

To get started with this boilerplate, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shivams1007/node-electron-boilerplate.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd your-repository
   npm install
   ```

## Development

To start the development server and launch the Electron application, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will compile the application and launch it in a development environment with hot reloading enabled.

## Building for Production

To build the application for production, follow these steps:

### Windows

```bash
npm run build:win
```

This will generate an executable file for Windows.

### macOS

```bash
npm run build:mac
```

This will generate an application package for macOS.

### Linux

```bash
npm run build:linux
```

This will generate an executable file for Linux.

- `server/`: Contains the source code of the Nodejs Server.
- `public/`: Contains static assets that will be included in the build.
- `build/`: Contains the built application files.
